# About Kinopio

<img src="/assets/logo-base.png" width=100/>

Kinopio is the thinking, diagramming, and planning tool for your hardest problems.

It works how our brains work.

[add vids and quick guides from post]

I made Kinopio to help you connect your thoughts, ideas, and plans together.

> I like how cute and quirky it is and I'm surprised at how it's helping me organise my thoughts without even trying, It's like magic. – raph
