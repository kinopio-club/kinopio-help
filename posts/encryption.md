## Encryption In-Flight

Kinopio uses current best practices for securing your information, including encrypting data in-flight, salting/hashing user passwords, and not recording sensitive or private information in logs.

## About End-to-End Encryption

Unfortunately, data is not currently end-to-end encrypted because there's no straight-forward way to encrypt data that you're able to collaborate on.

If you have thoughts or ideas on encryption, please do share it on the [forum](https://forum.kinopio.club) â€“ it's really appreciated.
