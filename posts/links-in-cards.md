So you might know that adding a URL (like [spacejam.com](https://spacejam.com)) to a card enables a `→` link button on the card.

## Multiple URLs

In cards with multiple URLs (e.g. images, audio, and links), if a link URL is available, the `→` card button use the link, otherwise it'll use the first URL in the card.

So if I have a card with an image url and a link like:

> https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/kinopio-uploads/prwduNJJz32Dn6C1VopLX/image.png
this is an image with a link to
folklore.org

The `→` will link to [folklore.org](folklore.org)


## Hiding Links

There are times when you might not want to display the link URL on a card, but still have a `→` button for a clickable link.

You can toggle hiding links in a card by clicking the `👀 Link` button
