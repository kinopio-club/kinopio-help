Invite Collaborators to give them edit access to the contents of your space. Inviting is especially useful for working together on `Private` spaces, but you can do it with any privacy setting.

You should think of collaborators as people you fully trust because they'll be able to edit and remove almost everything in a space.

> If collaborating with people you don't know or fully trust, consider changing your space privacy to `Open` and sharing the normal URL instead. That way others will only be able to add  and edit the cards that they've created.

## Invite Collaborator

Send someone a collaborator invite by copying the URL found in `Spaces → Invite Collaborators`
