## Description

[Kinopio](http://kinopio.club) is the visual thinking tool for new ideas and hard problems.

By making it easy to get your thoughts out and form connections organically, Kinopio works how our brains work.

[Uses of Kinopio](/posts/uses-of-kinopio/)

## History

Before Kinopio, I was the co-creator of Glitch.com, where I designed and built its original user interfaces.

In 2019, I quit my job to create a different kind of productivity tool. Instead of being about tracking tasks or traditional project management, Kinopio is designed to help you organize complex thoughts, create new ideas, and make hard decisions.

## Features

- No sign up required to use
- A unique and intuitive interface that's easy to use
- Works on both desktops and phones
- [Explore] community created spaces and templates
- Shareable public spaces
- Invite collaborators to private spaces
- keyboard shortcuts for power users
