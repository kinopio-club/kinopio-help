Prevent cards from being accidentally moved, edited, or deleted by locking them.

Helpful for backgrounds, grouping your space into sections, or for defining content that your collaborators shouldn't edit.

Lock cards or multiple selected cards through `Styles â†’ Lock`. Unlock cards by clicking the `Lock button` on the card.
