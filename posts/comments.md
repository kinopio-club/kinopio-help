Comment cards are smaller than normal cards and a bit transparent, letting you give feedback without feeling like you’re ‘intruding’ on the original space. Hover over cards to read them.

You can turn cards into comments via either `Card → More Options → Comment`, or by typing `((`.

If you have a space that you want to share with your team, but want to ensure that they only leave comments on, you can get a comment-only invite link through `Share → Invite Collaborators → Comment`.

Other uses for comments:

- Spoilers
- Choose your own adventure novels

## Pro-Tips

- Completely hide comments through the [Filters](/posts/filters) menu inside `Search`.
- Also just like adding other cards, comments you add to a space with collaborators will send them a [notification](/posts/notifications).
- Comments also work great with tags, checkboxes, and frames. So you can use a use a checkbox to mark resolved cards, and form associations with content using connections and tags.
