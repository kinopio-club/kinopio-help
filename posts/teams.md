Assign spaces to teams to share them with multiple people at once. Each team member can see and edit all of the spaces in a team.

Teams are helpful if you want to share and collaborate often with the same people on whiteboards, brainstorms, meeting notes, and diagrams.


Each team member becomes an upgraded Kinopio user, so they can create unlimited cards on team spaces, and their own personal spaces too.

> Kinopio for Teams is in beta. While the product is being shaped, only users invited to the beta program have the ability to create teams. If you'd like to join the teams beta please email [hi@kinopio.club](mailto:hi@kinopio.club)

## Creating Teams

You can create as many teams as you'd like. A single team can be shared by a whole company, but you can create smaller teams for departments, or projects as well.

To create a new team, click on `yourself → Teams → New Team`. You'll be able to change the color and name of the team at any time.

## Inviting Team Members

Adding people to your team is very similar to inviting them to a space. From your teams list, click on the name of a team, and click `Copy Invite to Team URL`.

Anyone you share the invite code with will be added to your team. If they don't yet have a Kinopio account, they'll be added once they sign up.

> In the future, I'm planning on adding the ability to invite team members by email (just like you can with space invites).

# Team User Permissions

Team users can have the role of `member` or `admin`.

**Members** can add their spaces to the team, edit team spaces, and invite other people to the team.

**Admins** can do everything members can, but they can also edit the team itself (e.g. team name and color), and can change the roles of other users on the team, and remove users from the team.

### Invite Non-Team Collaborators to a Space

Just like in a regular non-team space, collaborators can be invited to a team space through the `Share` button. Invited collaborators in a space will be able to create cards without counting against their free user card limit.

## Team Spaces


From your spaces list, you can see your personal spaces as well as spaces added to your teams. To add your own space to the team, open your space, click the Team button, and then select a team.

</video>


Each space can only belong to a single team. Spaces can only be added to teams by the original space creator.

If you see a team space in your spaces list, you can edit it. Once you add a card to that space you'll be treated like a space collaborator and will receive notifications when new cards are added there.

## Removing Users from the Team

Open the team details, by clicking on yourself, click the `Teams` button, then your team. If you're a team admin, you'll see the button under each user to `Remove from Team`.

</video>

Removing someone from the team immediately removes them as a collaborator from all team spaces, and transfers ownership of their team spaces to the admin.

The removed team user will no longer have access to any team spaces and will revert to being a free user. They will still have access to their account and personal spaces.

## Planned Pricing

During the beta period, teams are free.

Teams will cost 6$/user. If you have multiple teams with the same users on them, you'll only be charged once per unique user.

When teams are ready to ship to everyone, teams will be moved to a free trial and you'll have 14 days to decide whether to pay for them. If you choose not to pay, then team spaces will become read-only and team users will revert to free users.
