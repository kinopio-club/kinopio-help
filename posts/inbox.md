Use an Inbox space to collect thoughts, todos, and ideas that don't have a place to go yet. Your Inbox will appear above all your other spaces and favourites so it's always close at hand

(if you don't already have an Inbox, you can create one by renaming a space to `Inbox`)

## Add Ideas and URLs from Anywhere

Add anything to your inbox on the go with the Kinopio [browser extensions](http://localhost:8081/posts/extensions/), or through the system share sheet if you have the [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kinopio/id6448743101) installed

## Moving Inbox Cards to Your Other Spaces

You can access the cards in your Inbox anytime from `Sidebar â†’ Inbox`. Click a card in the list to move it from the inbox to your current space.
