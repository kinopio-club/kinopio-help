Get a birds eye view perspective and jump around big spaces with the minimap. There are two ways to use the minimap, while panning and from the sidebar.

## While Panning

The minimap will display while panning mode is active â€“ when either the space-key or the right-mouse button is held down.

## From the Footer

Clicking the little minimap button in the footer will also display the minimap and a list of boxes sorted by their starting `y` positions. You can click and drag on the minimap to quickly move around, and click on a box to jump to its position.

If you'd like, you can pin the sidebar to keep the minimap open while you work.

You can also use the `M` key to quick toggle the sidebar minimap at any time.
