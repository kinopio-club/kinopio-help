Assign spaces to Groups to share them with multiple people at once. Each Group member can see and edit all of the spaces in a Group.

Groups are helpful if you want to share and collaborate often with the same people on whiteboards, brainstorms, meeting notes, and diagrams.


Each Group member becomes an upgraded Kinopio user, so they can create unlimited cards on Group spaces, and their own personal spaces too.

> Only upgraded users can create groups, but any user on a group can contribute spaces to it

## Creating Groups

You can create as many Groups as you'd like. A single Group can be shared by a whole company, but you can create smaller Groups for departments, or projects as well.

To create a new Group, click on `yourself → Groups → New Group`. You'll be able to change the color and name of the Group at any time.

## Inviting Group Members

Adding people to your Group is very similar to inviting them to a space. From your Groups list, click on the name of a Group, and click `Copy Invite to Group URL`.

Anyone you share the invite code with will be added to your Group. If they don't yet have a Kinopio account, they'll be added once they sign up.

> In the future, I'm planning on adding the ability to invite Group members by email (just like you can with space invites).

# Group User Permissions

Group users can have the role of `member` or `admin`.

**Members** can add their spaces to the Group, edit Group spaces, and invite other people to the Group.

**Admins** can do everything members can, but they can also edit the Group itself (e.g. Group name and color), and can change the roles of other users on the Group, and remove users from the Group.

### Invite Non-Group Collaborators to a Space

Just like in a regular non-Group space, collaborators can be invited to a Group space through the `Share` button. Invited collaborators in a space will be able to create cards without counting against their free user card limit.

## Group Spaces


From your spaces list, you can see your personal spaces as well as spaces added to your Groups. To add your own space to the Group, open your space, click the Group button, and then select a Group.

Each space can only belong to a single Group. Spaces can only be added to Groups by the original space creator.

If you see a Group space in your spaces list, you can edit it. Once you add a card to that space you'll be treated like a space collaborator and will receive notifications when new cards are added there.

## Removing Users from the Group

Open the Group details, by clicking on yourself, click the `Groups` button, then your Group. If you're a Group admin, you'll see the button under each user to `Remove from Group`.

Removing someone from the Group immediately removes them as a collaborator from all Group spaces, and transfers ownership of their Group spaces to the admin.

The removed Group user will no longer have access to any Group spaces and will revert to being a free user. They will still have access to their account and personal spaces.

## Planned Pricing

During the beta period, Groups are free.

Groups will cost 6$/user. If you have multiple Groups with the same users on them, you'll only be charged once per unique user.

When Groups are ready to ship to everyone, Groups will be moved to a free trial and you'll have 14 days to decide whether to pay for them. If you choose not to pay, then Group spaces will become read-only and Group users will revert to free users.
