## If you haven't made an account

If you haven't signed up yet, then only you can see what you make regardless of privacy setting.

## If you are signed up

Change space privacy, share space URLs, and invite collaborators from `Share`.

The space privacy setting dictates who can see what. You can change space privacy from `Share` or by clicking the `Space` name button. Each setting in the privacy dialog explains who'll be able to see and edit your space.

You can also reference specific cards via `Card â†’ Share`. This URL will open the space, scroll to the card, and highlight it.

## Collaborating

When you invite others you'll see their cursors, paint strokes, and other actions in real time. Here's an [example](https://x.com/sfpc/status/1597727116556390404) by the School For Poetic Computation (SFPC).

## Pro-Tips

- New spaces default to `Private`
- You can also use [groups](/posts/groups) to share access to multiple spaces with the same group of people.
