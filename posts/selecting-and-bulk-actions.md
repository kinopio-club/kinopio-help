You can move or edit multiple cards and connections at once by dragging from an empty area to paint over them. Being able to move and edit many cards together is one of Kinopio's most powerful features.

On mobile, you'll need to press and hold on an empty area and then drag to paint.

## Selecting All Boxes to Below or to the Right to Make Room in Crowded Spaces

Oftentimes in busy spaces cards will be get clustered together, not leaving room for you to make new related cards in that area. To solve this you can hover your mouse near the left or top edge of the window and drag to select everything past that point. This will also select locked items so when you drag your selection, everything will move together.
