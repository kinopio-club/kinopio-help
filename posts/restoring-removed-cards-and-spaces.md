If you've accidentally removed/deleted a card or space, you can restore it back through `Sidebar â†’ Removed`. From there, you'll be able to restore or permanently delete cards or spaces. Removed items are never permanently deleted without you explicitly doing so.

> A permanently removed card or space is immediately deleted from the database and cannot be restored, so be careful.
