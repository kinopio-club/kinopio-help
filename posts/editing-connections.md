The connection lines between cards all have a connection type. These connection types have a name and color that can be shared amongst the connections on your space.

By default new connections will use the last connection type, but you can make new connections use unique types/colors by unchecking `Use Last Type`

## Painting to select multiple connections lets you assign them all to the same connection type
