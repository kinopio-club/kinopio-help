Add `[[tags]]` to your cards to make them stand out and connect ideas across spaces.

To add a tag into a card you can either type `[[` and start typing your tag, then `tab` or `enter` to complete it. You can also add tags to a card or a paint selection through the [Style](/posts/styling-cards/) menu.
