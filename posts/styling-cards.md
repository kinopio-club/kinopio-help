You can also paint multiple cards to style them together,

If you're often using the same card color, or want to use a specific color in a space, you can quick change your default New Card Color from the footer.

Happy styling ヾ(＾∇＾)


## Resizing and Tilting Cards

To resize a card, drag it's bottom-right corner. To tilt, drag from the bottom-left. Double click a corner to reset size or tilt.

On mobile, tilting is unavailable, and you'll need to be pinch zoomed in ~60% before you can resize.
