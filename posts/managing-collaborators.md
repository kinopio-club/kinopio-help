You, or your collaborators, can view the list of space collaborators from `Share`.

You'll be able to get more info on each collaborator, or favorite them, as well as remove them from the space.

> For security reasons, when you remove a collaborator from a space unused invite URLs will become invalid. You'll need to send out a new invite URL. This won't affect existing collaborators.
