title: How Much Does Kinopio Cost? (Pricing)
tags: ['About Kinopio']

All features of Kinopio are free to use and collaborate with, up to a limit of 100 cards and an upload file size limit of 5mb.

> Kinopio costs $8/month or $88/year (USD) for unlimited cards and uploads

I want the pricing to feel simple, straightforward, and obvious.

📈 Cards you add will increment the card count

📉 Cards you remove will decrement the card count

👯‍♀️ For easier collaboration, if you're editing a space that was created by an upgraded user, your card count won't increase. You can check whether your card limit will change by clicking your user icon while in a space.

## Why a Subscription?

To build and maintain a service with ongoing costs that increase over time (servers etc), subscription pricing is the only economically sustainable business model to ensure that Kinopio is supported for the long-term.
