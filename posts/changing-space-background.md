You can edit the background for your current space by clicking the icon next to your space name.

> Backgrounds are just urls, much like images in cards, so feel free to copy in image urls from elsewhere on the web too

## Set a Tint Color

Highlight backgrounds with tint colors, personalize the default wallpaper or dye any background image

## Set Defaults

Prefer grids over squiggles? Or a different background color? You can change your default background for new spaces by

1. Set up a space background image and tint color that you'd like to use
2. Make it the default for new spaces in `User → Settings → Colors and Themes`
