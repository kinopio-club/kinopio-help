The Kinopio API is used to find, save, and update the spaces of signed up users. You can use it to make cool things too.

Use of the API is subject to the [Use Restrictions Policy](/posts/use-restrictions-policy/).

## Authentication

Kinopio uses token-based authentication using your user `apiKey`. You can get your apiKey in the app through `User → Settings → Account → Developer Info`.

> 🙈 Your API key carries the same privileges as your user account, so be sure to keep it secret!

Use your apiKey in the `Authorization` header of each request.

(For testing, you can also use a query string (`?apiKey=`) but this is less secure and not recommended)

## Rate Limits

The API is limited to 5 requests per second. If you exceed this rate, you will receive a `429` response and will need to wait 30 seconds before subsequent requests will succeed.

## Routes


<a class="anchor" name="all"></a>
<h2 class="badge all">All</h2>

[https://api.kinopio.club](https://api.kinopio.club) is the base path for all routes

Method | Name | Description | Auth
--- | --- | --- | ---
`GET` | <code class="all">/</code> | Confirm that the API server is online | None





<a class="anchor" data-section="👯‍♀️" name="users"></a>
<h2 class="badge users">Users</h2>

Users are representations of any account on Kinopio. Users are created by the server when they sign up.

<h3 class="badge users">User Routes</h3>

Routes with Auth as `apiKey` mean that the Authorization header apiKey must match the requested user.
